    <h1>React Blog</h1>
    <p class="group1">
      This blog is the official source for the updates from the React team. Anything important,
      including release notes or deprecation notices, will be posted here first. You can also
      follow the <a href="#">@reactjs</a> account on Twitter, but you won't miss anything essential if you only
      read this blog.

        <h2>React Labs: What We've Been Working On - February 2024</h2>
        <p class="time">February 15, 2024</p>
        <p class="group2">
            In React Labs posts, we write about projects in active research and development. Since our last
            update, we've made significant progress on React Compiler, new features, and React 19, and
            we'd like to share what we learned.

        <h2>React Canaries: Incremental Feature Rollout Outside Meta</h2>
        <p class="time">May 3, 2023</p>
        <p class="group2">
            Traditionally, new React features used to only be available at Meta first, and land in the open
            source releases later. We'd like to offer the React community an option to adopt individual new
            features as soon as their design is close to finalâ€”similar to how Meta uses React internally. We
            are introducing a new officially supported Canary release channel. It lets curated setups like
            frameworks decouple adoption of individual React features from the React release schedule.
